# Matrix Operations Examples

This directory contains educational examples to build intuition around matrix operations using PyTorch.

## Running Examples

Examples are available in two formats:

### Python Scripts

To run any example script:

```bash
python src/examples/example_file.py
```

### Jupyter Notebooks (Recommended)

For an interactive experience with better visualizations:

```bash
jupyter notebook src/examples/example_file.ipynb
```

Make sure you've installed the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Available Examples

- **Matrix Multiplication**: Learn matrix multiplication with visualizations showing how dimensions work, dot product interpretation, and dimension compatibility rules.
  - [Python Script](matrix_multiplication.py)
  - [Jupyter Notebook](matrix_multiplication.ipynb) (recommended for better visualizations)

Each example includes:
- Detailed visualizations
- Intuitive explanations of mathematical concepts
- Interactive demonstrations
- Practical applications
- Real-world use cases

## Contributing Examples

When creating new examples, please follow these guidelines:
- Provide both Python script and Jupyter notebook versions
- Focus on building intuition
- Include visualizations
- Explain the real-world applications
- Show step-by-step computation
- Use type hints and docstrings
- Add interactive elements when possible (especially in notebooks)
